Are you worried about how companies use your data? Do you believe that digitalization can improve our democracy and financial systems?

Then, tyron is the solution for you. Tyron aims to counteract some of the modern issues of who owns your data and how they use it. So far, we users don't have enough control of how much and to which extent companies process our private information. That's about to change.

The tyron.network will grant the power of data ownership to you, the end-user, empowering you to have control over your data.

But why do we need more data protection? And how is tyron specifically going to solve that?

## The problem
When shopping online, companies gather a lot of your personal information. Many times the data they require seems unnecessary - why do I need to disclose my gender when buying a book? And why do they want my phone number if they rarely use it to contact me? There are many examples of users giving away an unnecessary amount of data, for free. But your data has an immense value! You're just not getting any money for it.

Data is valuable because we can use it to develop and improve products and services based on feedback and user information. It should be our right to understand how private companies are making profits of our personal data - without having to read overly wordy "privacy policies". 

Every time you want to buy from an online shop you have to use an account managed by them and they can store your data for a long time. What if instead of many usernames and passwords, you could use your tyron.identity to represent you? An identity that proves itself by using a decentralized computer system and allows you to create different identifiers depending on who you're transacting with.

The problem is much larger than e-commerce: private data has been used to manipulate democratic elections. The question of whether we can trust companies with our data is urgent. Without transparency from the companies and options for the user to make a different choice, the problem of data misuse remains. But with tyron, the digital world could look much different for you. You could own your data - and even sell it if you want to.

## What is tyron?
Tyron is a blockchain service for you, the end-user.

Tyron is building an e-commerce network for peer-to-peer transactions where you own your identity and private information. For each company you interact with, you could create a unique digital identifier. From your account, you could manage all your identifiers and decide what personal information they have access to.

Using tyron, all the data you create is encrypted with your secret keys.

```
Own your data,
Empower your world.
```

> :zap: tyron derives from the Greek _turannos_ which means sovereign, and it's about giving data sovereignty to their users.

## The purpose of tyron
```
To give people the ownership of their data.
```
Ownership of your data means exclusive rights and control over your data.

:zap: The right to prove your identity with a _root of trust_ sytem that is not controlled by a private company. A system that relies upon computer code and decentralized technologies like blockchain.

:zap: The right to have an online identity that protects your privacy against unwanted data collectors and surveillance.

:zap: The right to control your data deciding how and where it is stored and managed.

### Vision
```tyron as open source software```

**Social enterprise** - Tyron's vision is to create a nonprofit open organization to manage this project.
### Values
:zap: To work to mitigate global warming.

:zap: To advocate for data rights as human rights.

### Profits
The end-users pay for the service through transaction fees.

Profits will fund sustainable projects to mitigate global warming. Users will also vote on these projects.

## Tyron's engineering
### Proof-of-Concept 1: _Own your data_
Tyron will leverage self-sovereign identity (```SSI```) to give data sovereignty to their users' cryptographic identities.

```Blockchain``` will be the backbone technology for the peer-to-peer tyron.network, allowing their users to prove who they are without a middleman.

How you store your data is decisive to claim ownership. Your tyron.identity gives you the secret keys to make such claims and the software that manages the storage of your data is your tyron.agent. Tyron agents can be stored in your phone and shall comply with ```Hyperledger``` blockchain technologies.

### Proof-of-Concept 2: _Sell your data_
What if you could share your market data for machine learning and influence where resources shall be allocated? Sustainability is key, and tyron believes that artificial intelligence has to be sustainable as well. Then let's start paying people for their data if they'd like to share, and make some money in return.

_Stay tuned._
