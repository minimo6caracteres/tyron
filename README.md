> Does it worry you how companies use your data?  
As users, we don't have enough control over how much and to which extent companies and third parties process our personal information.  
But why do we need more data protection? And how Tyron could solve that?

  <summary><b>The problem</b></summary>

<p>When shopping online, companies gather a lot of our personal information. Many times the data they require seems unnecessary - why do I need to disclose my gender to buy a random item?</p>

<p>We either create accounts with multiple companies or use an identity provider such as Facebook or Google. Thus identities on the internet remain centralized, and we often don’t know how our data is used and shared with third parties.</p>

<p>We give away all that data for free. But your data has an immense value! It is necessary to develop and improve products&services using artificial intelligence. You’re just not getting any money for it. Quite the opposite, people could use your data against you, to, e.g. manipulate democratic elections.</p>

<p>The problem is much larger than eCommerce, but what if you could use a digital identity that protects your privacy? What if you could shop online as you do with cash in real life?</p>

<p>With Tyron, the digital world could look much different for you. You could own your data - and even sell it, if you want to.</p>

## The purpose of Tyron
The word Tyron derives from the Greek _turannos_ that means sovereign, and Tyron's purpose is **to give people sovereignty over their data**.

The sovereignty over your data means exclusive rights and control over your data:
- The right to prove your identity with a digital system that is not controlled by any single company or organization. A system that relies upon open-source code and decentralized technologies like blockchain.

- The right to have a digital identity that protects your privacy against unwanted data collectors and surveillance.

- The right to control your data deciding how and where it is stored and managed.
