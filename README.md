## What tyron could be:
- An open-source e-commerce app for peer-to-peer transactions where each user owns their data! So you could buy and sell products and services, and sell your data if you want to.

> Are you worried about how companies use your data?  
> **Who owns your data, and how do they use it?** Users don't have enough control over how much and to which extent companies process our private information.  

> But why do we need more data protection? And how tyron could solve that?

## The problem
When shopping online, companies gather a lot of your personal information. Many times the data they require seems unnecessary - why do I need to disclose my gender when buying a book? And why do they want my phone number if they rarely use it to contact me? There are many examples of users giving away an unnecessary amount of data, for free. But your data has an immense value! You're just not getting any money for it.

Data is valuable because we can use it to develop and improve products and services based on feedback and user information. It should be our right to understand how private companies are making profits of our personal data - without having to read overly wordy "privacy policies". 

The problem is much larger than e-commerce: private data has been used to manipulate democratic elections. The question of whether we can trust companies with our data is urgent. Without transparency from the companies and options for the user to make a different choice, the problem of data misuse remains. But with tyron, the digital world could look much different for you. You could own your data - and even sell it, if you want to.

## The purpose of tyron
```
To give people the ownership of their data.
```
> tyron derives from the Greek _turannos_ which means sovereign, and it's about giving data sovereignty to their users.

Ownership of your data means exclusive rights and control over your data.

- The right to prove your identity with a digital system that is not controlled by a private company. A system that relies upon open source code and decentralized technologies like blockchain.

- The right to have a digital identity that protects your privacy against unwanted data collectors and surveillance.

- The right to control your data deciding how and where it is stored and managed.
