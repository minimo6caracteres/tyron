## How to contribute :zap:
1. Create a GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) - for free, you just need a username, email and password.
2. Go to [tyron's repository](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron) and in the upper right click the Star and Fork buttons - forking means you're creating your own copy of tyron's repository! 
>> :mag: repositories are like books with folders and files.
 

More info coming soon!
