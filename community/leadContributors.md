# Tyron lead contributors :zap:
Lead contributors will receive payment for their time contributing to tyron. 

Anyone that contributes to tyron can become a lead contributor - no matter your background or technical expertise but your actions and contributions. 

That's meritocracy for tyron, the power of your ideas! You're also welcome to help to rethink and not to overthink - it has to be simple enough for everyone to feel encouraged to contribute.

Start sharing your ideas keeping the following aspects in mind:
- Product: Open-source e-commerce app for peer-to-peer transactions where the user owns their data.  
- Purpose: To give people the ownership of their data.
- Vision: ```tyron as open source software``` and tyron as a [social enterprise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-enterprise.asp) - [registeret social√∏konomisk virksomhed (RSV)](/partnerships&compliance/files/incorporation.md) - a nonprofit & open organization to manage the projects.
- Values:
:recycle: To advocate for data rights as human rights  
:recycle: To use profits to work to mitigate global warming!

## What is a tyron lead contributor
Open organization means not only open-source software but also transparent management and online collaboration.  
Modern management is not about traditional hierarchies so tyron.global won't have chief officers but lead contributors selected by meritocracy.

So basically, everyone working per wage for the organization will be a lead contributor. In general terms, there will be the following departments:
- [Engineering](/community/contributors/engineering.md)
- [Communication & society](/community/contributors/communication&society.md)
- [Economy & finance](/community/contributors/economy&finance.md)
- [Design & marketing](/community/contributors/design&marketing.md)
- [Partnerships & compliance](/community/contributors/partnerships&compliance.md)
