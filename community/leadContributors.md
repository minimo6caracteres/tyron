**Recap**:
- **Product**: Open-source eCommerce app for peer-to-peer private transactions where the user owns their data.  
- **Purpose**: To give people the ownership of their data.
- **Vision**: *A world where people have access to an online market that protects their privacy and personal information, a market with low barriers to entry for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  
A society where data-driven businesses’ success is not at the expenses of people’s rights.*
- **Values**:  
:recycle: To advocate for data rights as human rights  
:recycle: To use profits to mitigate global warming!

## Open organization
Open organization means not only open-source software but also transparent management and online collaboration.  
Modern management shouldn't be about traditional hierarchies so Tyron won't have chief officers but lead contributors selected by meritocracy.

So basically, everyone working per wage for the organization will be a lead contributor. In general terms, there will be the following departments:
- [Engineering](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/engineering.md)
- [Communication & society](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/communication&society.md)
- [Economy & finance](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/economy&finance.md)
- [Design & marketing](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/design&marketing.md)
- [Partnerships & compliance](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/partnerships&compliance.md)
