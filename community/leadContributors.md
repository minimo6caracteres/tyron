# LEAD CONTRIBUTORS
Those committed to the project and that want Tyron to achieve its purpose for the public good.  
Lead contributors could receive payment for their time contributing to Tyron.

Anyone that contributes to Tyron could become a lead contributor - no matter your background or technical expertise but your actions and contributions. 

## Open organization
Open organization means not only open-source software but also transparent management and online collaboration.  
Modern management shouldn't be about traditional hierarchies so Tyron won't have chief officers but lead contributors selected by meritocracy.

So basically, everyone working per wage for the organization will be a lead contributor. In general terms, there will be the following departments:
- [Engineering](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/engineering.md)
- [Communication & society](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/communication&society.md)
- [Economy & finance](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/economy&finance.md)
- [Design & marketing](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/design&marketing.md)
- [Partnerships & compliance](https://github.com/pungtas/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/partnerships&compliance.md)
