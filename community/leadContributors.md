## Open organization
Open organization means not only open-source software but also transparent management and online collaboration.  
Modern management shouldn't be about traditional hierarchies so tyron won't have chief officers but lead contributors selected by meritocracy.

So basically, everyone working per wage for the organization will be a lead contributor. In general terms, there will be the following departments:
- [Engineering](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/engineering.md)
- [Communication & society](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/communication&society.md)
- [Economy & finance](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/economy&finance.md)
- [Design & marketing](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/design&marketing.md)
- [Partnerships & compliance](https://github.com/tyronNetwork/tyron/blob/master/community/contributors/partnerships&compliance.md)
