|# This file's [Intro](#intro)| What economy & finance mean for Tyron's purpose: to give people sovereignty over their data.|
|# Financial & business model| 
|# Cash flow|
|# Cryptocurrencies| Stablecoins like [libra](https://github.com/libra/libra) and [utility tokens](http://www.ecri.eu/system/tdf/thomas_duenser_1.pdf?file=1&type=node&id=155&force=0).|
|# Staking capital | To cover operating costs such as network maintenance and salaries.| Like Sovrin, Tyron could have [stewards](https://sovrin.org/stewards/) that operate the nodes of the decentralized network through a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, providing the *staking capital*.|
