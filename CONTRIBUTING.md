## Open source software & license
```Open source software``` means you have the freedom to use, study, copy, modify and distribute the source code.  
For tyron, these permissions are enforced through a [GNU Affero General Public License](./license) that protects your contributor rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Some open-source licenses permit making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. This is especially important for the tyron.network :zap:
