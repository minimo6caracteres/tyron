## Open source software & license
```Open source software``` means you have the freedom to use, study, copy, modify and distribute the source code.  
For tyron, these permissions are enforced through a [GNU Affero General Public License](/LICENSE) that protects your contributor rights with two steps: (1) asserts copyright on the software, and (2) offers you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  
Some open-source licenses permit making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. This is especially important for the tyron.network :zap:

## How to contribute :high_brightness:
1. Create a GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) - for free, you just need a username, email and password.

2. From the list below, choose the key areas you'd like to contribute.  
Follow the link, and in the upper right corner click the 'pencil button' ("Edit the file in your fork of this project").
    > GitHub will tell you that: You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork '(yourUsername)/tyron', so you can send a pull request to tyronNetwork/tyron.  
    > Forking means you're creating your own copy of tyron's repository! :zap:
    > > :mag: repositories are like books with folders and files; it's how a project is organized.   
    
    > At the bottom of the edit page, **Commit changes** giving it a short name that describes your contribution, plus an optional extended description.
